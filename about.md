## Who We Are

We're a student organization that hosts social events and community service events for students to network and have fun, and corporate and techical talks to help companines recruit on campus and students advance their careers. We also work with HKN to manage and staff the dB Cafe, a food stand that provides food and refresments at a low cost.

Our organization has a fairly large reach, with over 400 members -- composed of students in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science -- and two to three events per week throughout the Fall and Winter semesters. Our goal is to make sure that our members will be up-to-date with technical advances in their fields and have greater career opportunities.
