##About the University of Michigan Student Branch

As a student organization, we have a strong presence on campus and a strong backing from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). To learn more about IEEE, check out below. On campus, we have technical speakers present at our meetings, company representatives talk about their technology and recruit our students, social events, and community service events. Also, we work with HKN to manage and staff the dB cafe, a food stand that provides food at a low cost to students, faculty, and anyone else who comes by our stand. We have a strong executive board along with five committees to run IEEE at UM. Our committees are the service, projects, publicity, activities, and corporate committees.

##About IEEE Nationals

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the world's largest technical professional society. IEEE at the University of Michigan is student branch of National IEEE, and was set up on March 25, 1904. Now there are over 400 members, including students, faculty and staff.

Here at the University of Michigan, IEEE serves as a resource for electrical engineering, computer engineering and computer science students. We provide our members opportunities to enhance their academic, professional, and social lives. IEEE is a fairly active student group with a large reach, with two to three events per week throughout the Fall and Winter semesters. The goal of IEEE is to make sure that our members have the exposure to new technical advances in their fields and greater career opportunities.

We strongly encourage all of our members to participate in our events. All opportunities in this organization are for your benefit -- don't miss out on opportunities to help enhance your college life!
