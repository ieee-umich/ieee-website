##About the University of Michigan Student Branch

As a student organization, we have a strong presence on campus and a strong backing from the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). To learn more about IEEE, check out below. On campus, we have technical speakers present at our meetings, company representatives talk about their technology and recruit our students, social events, and community service events. Also, we work with HKN to manage and staff the dB cafe, a food stand that provides food at a low cost to students, faculty, and anyone else who comes by our stand.We have a strong executive board along with five committees to run IEEE at UM. Our committees are the service, projects, publicity, activities, and corporate committees.
