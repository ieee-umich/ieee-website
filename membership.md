#### Interested in joining IEEE? Great! Follow these 3 simple steps and you will be granted active status!

### Step 1: Become a National IEEE Member
Buy national IEEE membership online at [ieee.org/join_renew](https://www.ieee.org/join_renew). This will give you instant access to exclusive IEEE membership benefits!

### Step 2: Notify Your Membership Purchase
Let us know that you completed Step 1. You can do so by sending us your Member Number along with a screenshot of your membership purchase receipt to [IEEE.Membership@umich.edu](IEEE.Membership@umich.edu).

### Step 3: Become an Active Student Branch Member
Come to our hosted events! We take attendance at every event we host, so attend at least 2 of our events throughout each semester. Don't worry, we host A LOT of events throughout the semester (e.g. mass meetings, corporate events, social events, professor talks and more!), so feel free to attend the events that interests you. Of course, we would _love_ to see you at every event:)

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our Membership Chair at: [IEEE.Membership@umich.edu](mailto:IEEE.Membership@umich.edu)
