#### Interested in joining IEEE? Great! Follow these 3 simple steps and you will be granted active status!

### Step 1: Become a National IEEE Member
Buy national IEEE membership online at [ieee.org/join_renew](https://www.ieee.org/join_renew). This will give you instant access to exclusive IEEE membership benefits!

### Step 2: Notify Your Membership Purchase
Let us know that you completed Step 1. You can do so by sending us your Member Number along with a screenshot of your membership purchase receipt to [IEEE.Membership@umich.edu](IEEE.Membership@umich.edu).

### Step 3: Participate as an Active Student Branch Member
Come to our hosted events! We have a lot of events throughout the semester (e.g. mass meetings, corporate events, social events, professor talks and more!), so feel free to attend the events that interests you. Being an active member gives you access to more exclusive events (early meetings with some companies, end of the year banquet, and more!) and we also include your resume in the resume book that we send out to companies!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our Membership Chair at [IEEE.Membership@umich.edu](mailto:IEEE.Membership@umich.edu)
