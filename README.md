## Getting Started

- Install Jekyll  
`gem install jekyll`

- And Probably a Bunch of Other Dependencies (please add to this list if you find any)  
`gem install bundler`  
`bundle install`  
`gem install nokogiri` (this should be included in `bundle install`, but I had to install it separately)  
`gem install rouge`

- Navigate to Website Directory in Your Terminal (obviously you need to `git clone` this repo first...)

- Run `jekyll serve` (if you're lucky)  
I had to `bundle exec jekyll serve`
